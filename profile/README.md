# Second itteration (wip)
Rework previous applications to make lightweight, efficient, decentralized tools for any platforms.
Moving from Flutter to Rust. Will be build using [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/).
For ukuvota I will use the astro implementaiton and slowly transition it.

Not yet ready. Use first itteration apps.
